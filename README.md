# Tripver

## What is Tripver?
This project is the development of a mobile application that helps the travellers to know new local people and at the same time it shows a number of interesting places in the city. With this, a more directly interaction is achieved between tourists and locals being able to benefit each other from their culture, language and the experience of meeting new people. To do so, the application will show the tourists the local users or tourist places that are close and to the local users, it will show the tourists that are travelling in that city.
